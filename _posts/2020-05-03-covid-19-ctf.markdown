## Covid Scammers

They have given binary file (ELF 32 bit) need to answer the below questions



The heading that contains [Not confirmed] means it is found after the ctf is over, it may or maynot be the correct flag.

### 1. Free Flag

You've been contacted by a high-end but morally ambiguous finance company (unhackable-bitcoin-wallet.com) to investigate a data breach. The box in question is a mail server in their internal network, a sample of the malware found on the system has been pulled and given to you. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to reverse-engineer the sample and locate, fuzz and exploit the C2 server, and then hack-back to learn about the malicious actor and recover the stolen documents.

Download this binary to begin!

Look for the free flag. Get on the scoreboard!

given the binary file

```
covid{freeFlagLookatMe}
```


### 2. Arch

What architecture is this sample compiled for?
```
x86
```

### 3. Who Me? [Not confirmed]

What is this malware sample called (not the actual binary name)?
```
TheCovidBotNet
```

### 4. Scouting

What is the C2 server? Provide the domain as the answer.
```
covidfunds.net
```

### 5. This is nice, might stay a while...

How does the malware persist? SHA1 hash the path of the persistence location.

echo -n "/full/path" | sha1sum

```
/etc/init.d/zorr
```

### 6. License and Registration Please

The malware creates a UUID and stores it in a file, what is the name of this file. 
Provide the SHA1 hash of the full path as the flag.

```
/tmp/.serverauth.tn6aUcM0uM
```

### 8. Shared Secrets [Not confirmed]

The malware creates a shared-memory object and stores a flag inside. Recover the flag.
```
covid{kEepItSeCrETmR.Fr0dO!}
```

### 9. PROTOCOL1 [Not confirmed]

What string/message does the malware use to register itself with the C2 server as a new infected host?

Include the FULL message (including client specific data).

All protocol questions will be less points after this one.

```
NEW goHct1tkuuvjiey0w9B
```
